    <h1>Co-Creation Symposium</h1>
    <h3>Call Out for Contributions</h3>
            <h2>Info</h2>
            <p>
            This symposium aims to explore the concept of co-creation and its application in art, creative health and wellbeing projects.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Co-Creation is a way of working together that enables everyone involved to participate in a reflexive, dynamic process, where inclusivity and equality are central to the outcome. 
            </p>   
            <p> 
            Co-Creation happens when there is open engagement with all participants, when it is grounded in mutual respect and acknowledges the holistic benefits to all. This way of working means that there is the potential for organic creative growth, enabling connectivity, social equity and equanimity to emerge.
            </p>
            <p>
            We have observed that, at present, co-creation is considered as an essential component of creative health projects. However, this element is often not fully incorporated by all stakeholders and participants, rather it is seen as an add-on and applied in order to secure resources and label projects as inclusive.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            How different might the landscape of creative health be if the concept of co-creation was rooted in lived experience from the outset? In what ways might true co-creation inform a project and its outputs?
